# Day 11

🎯 Day 11 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🔍 SQL – Ranking, Market Share, and Month-over-Month Growth

Today I dove deeper into advanced SQL techniques and built two separate but insightful queries from my mock sales data:

✅ Query 1: Month-over-Month Growth by Product

   - Aggregated revenue per product per month

   - Used LAG() to fetch previous month's revenue

   - Handled missing values with COALESCE()

   - Calculated % change in revenue month-over-month

   - Cleanly formatted results to show percentage differences  
    📈 This is perfect for spotting product momentum or slowdowns over time.


✅ Query 2: Market Share by Product within Category

  - Created a CTE to calculate total revenue per category

  - Calculated each product’s contribution to its category

  - Sorted results to reveal top market share holders
    📊 This helps identify dominant products in each category — crucial for sales and product strategy.

💡 These SQL patterns are incredibly useful in real-world reporting: growth tracking, competitor benchmarking, and resource allocation.

⏱️ All built within my 1-hour daily limit.
